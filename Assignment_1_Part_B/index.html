    <p>Non-vegetarian food  contains meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, or the flesh of any 
        other animal), and sometimes, eggs. The term is common in India, 
        but not usual elsewhere. In the generally vegetarian environment of 
        India, restaurants offering meat and fish usually have a "non-vegetarian"
         section of their menu, and may include the term (typically as "Veg and Non-veg") 
         in their name-boards and advertising. When describing people, non-vegetarians eat
          meat and/or eggs, as opposed to vegetarian. But in India, consumption of dairy 
          foods is usual for both groups.

    <h1>Mutton</h1>
    <p>
        Mutton curry recipe uses onions and tomatoes as the base, which is then 
        flavoured using different whole and ground spices. The hero ingredient of this
         recipe is the meat masala (different from curry powder most commonly available abroad), 
        responsible for giving this whole dish that distinctive warm and spicy flavour.

    <h1>Fish</h1>
    <p>
        Baked fish might sound a bit pedestrian…until you’ve tried this Mediterranean baked 
        fish recipe! One bite and you’ll be singing its praises. 
        Roast up any white fish with lemon, garlic and a simple mix of tomatoes, onions and olives.
